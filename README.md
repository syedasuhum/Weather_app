I've created a functional weather website with the features like:

1. City Search: Users can input a city name and fetch weather data
2. Weather Display: Shows temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed
3. Loading State: Displays a spinning loader while fetching data
4. Error Handling: Shows error messages for failed requests
5. Local Storage: Saves and retrieves the last searched city
6. Responsive Design: Works well on all screen sizes

Here I have use free API key at OpenWeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org/api)

The website features:
Real-time weather data fetching
Temperature in Celsius
Wind speed in meters per second
Humidity percentage
Weather condition description
Smooth loading states
Error handling
Persistent storage of the last search
Beautiful icons from Lucide React
Responsive and modern design with Tailwind CSS
The app is now running on the development server. You can test it by entering a city name and clicking the search icon or pressing enter.
