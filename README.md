I've created a functional weather app with the features like:

1. City Search: Users can input a city name and fetch weather data
2. Weather Display: Shows temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed
3. Loading State: Displays a spinning loader while fetching data
4. Error Handling: Shows error messages for failed requests
5. Local Storage: Saves and retrieves the last searched city
6. Responsive Design: Works well on all screen sizes

Here I have use free API key at OpenWeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org/api)

The features of the weather application include:

-> Real-time weather data fetching

-> Temperature in Celsius

-> Wind speed in meters per second

-> Humidity percentage
-> Weather condition description
-> Smooth loading states and Error handling
-> Persistent storage of the last search
-> icons from Lucide React


What Tech Stack I have use 
> React as framework(useState, useEffect)
> Fetching API as openWeatherMap
